# BMAD Learning Module

BMAD learns and adapts to the user and project so workflows and agents get better over time. Learning is stored separately from workflow state and is reused across sessions.

## Where BMAD stores learning

- **Context engine (recommended)** — Use the context memory engine with namespace `learning` so all agents can search and use the same data.
  - Store: `bmad context store <key> "<content>" --namespace learning`
  - Search: `bmad context search "<query>"` (learning entries are in the same vector store; use key/namespace to scope).
  - Keys can be: `user.preferences`, `project.conventions`, `user.corrections`, `project.tech-choices`, etc.
- **Agent sidecars** — Existing pattern: per-agent files under `_bmad/_memory/<agent>-sidecar/` (e.g. tech-writer-sidecar/documentation-standards.md). Agents can update these when the user gives feedback or preferences.
- **Project context** — Generated by document-project workflow; used by implementation workflows. Learning can influence what gets into project context over time (e.g. user preferences in docs).

## What to record (BMAD learning)

- **User preferences** — Communication style, output format, level of detail, language.
- **Project conventions** — Naming, structure, frameworks, tools the user prefers.
- **Corrections** — When the user corrects an agent (e.g. "use tabs not spaces"), store a short rule so future runs follow it.
- **Decisions** — Architecture or process decisions the user made so agents don’t suggest the same alternatives again.

## How agents use learning

- At the start of a workflow or agent session, run `bmad context search "<current task>"` and include any `learning` namespace hits in the prompt or load sidecar files from `_bmad/_memory/`.
- When the user gives explicit feedback or a correction, the agent should store it via `bmad context store <key> "<summary of preference or correction>" --namespace learning`.
- Prefer context engine for shared learning; use sidecar files for agent-specific standards (e.g. documentation-standards.md for the tech writer).

## Reusability

- Learning is stored under `_bmad/_memory/` or in `_bmad/_memory/context.sqlite` (context engine). These paths are inside the project’s BMAD directory, so each project can have its own learning. For a reusable template, exclude `_bmad` from the repo (it’s generated on install) or commit a minimal default so others can run the same setup.
